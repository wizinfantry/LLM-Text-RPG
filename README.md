# LLM-Text-RPG

> A simple terminal-based D&D style RPG built with Node.js that uses a local LLM (like Ollama's Gemma) to dynamically generate monsters, items, and combat scenarios.

This project is a proof-of-concept demonstrating how Large Language Models can create dynamic and unpredictable content for games, making every playthrough unique. The LLM is responsible for creating monsters, generating item drops, and narrating combat actions in real-time.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Dynamic Monster Generation**: Every monster is created on-the-fly by the LLM, complete with unique names, descriptions, stats, and special abilities based on the player's level.
* **Procedural Item Drops**: Defeated monsters can drop unique weapons generated by the LLM, with distinct names, damage, and effects.
* **LLM-Powered Combat Narration**: Monsters don't just use "attack." The LLM chooses their actions (like "bolster defense" or "use a special skill") and provides flavorful descriptions for each turn.
* **Classic RPG Mechanics**: Features familiar mechanics like leveling, stats (STR, DEX, etc.), HP/MP bars, and turn-based combat.
* **Highly Extensible**: The code is organized into modules (`player.js`, `monster.js`, `utils.js`), making it easy to add new features.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

* **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)**: The runtime environment for executing the JavaScript code.
* **[Ollama](https://ollama.com/)**: Used to run the Large Language Model locally. This project was tested with the `gemma3:latest` model.
* **[Axios](https://axios-http.com/)**: A promise-based HTTP client to communicate with the Ollama API.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the game running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed before you begin:

1.  **Node.js**: You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
2.  **Ollama**: Follow the installation guide at [ollama.com](https://ollama.com/).

### Installation

1.  **Set up Ollama and pull a model.**

    After installing Ollama, you need to pull a model to run the game. We recommend Gemma 3. Open your terminal and run:

    ```bash
    ollama pull gemma3:latest
    ```

    Ensure the Ollama server is running in the background.

2.  **Clone the repository.**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/wizinfantry/LLM-Text-RPG.git
    cd LLM-Text-RPG
    ```
    
3.  **Install project dependencies.**

    This project uses `axios`. Install it via npm:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Game

Once the setup is complete, start the game by running:

```bash
node main.js
